# web-boilerplate
Simple HTML/CSS/JS boilerplate for the modern web. Viva la productivity, viva la not doing shit twice.

### Usage

By default this Gulpfile assumes that dev work is performed in the project root directory and production work in a `build` directory.

To change this, simply tweak the appropriate values under the `paths` object.


To see a list of possible tasks:
